# Bentley DITA V1.1 DocTypes

2019-09-18

This plug-in contains DTDs for backwards comparability for any DITA v1.1 topics or maps using Benltey's specializations. It has been re-factored since the original creation to reference the OASIS DITA v1.1 DTDs (these are only shells and custom domains).

## To do
* Need to create a separate catalog / folder set that allows for switching the system DTD names between "stock" DITA and SDL's customized version.
* Potentially may need schema versions of these.
