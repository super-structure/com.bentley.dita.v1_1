2019-09-18

This plug-in contains DTDs for backwards comparability for any DITA v1.1 topics or maps using Benltey's specializations. It has been re-factored since the original creation to reference the OASIS DITA v1.1 DTDs (these are only shells and custom domains).

## To do
Refer to the [GitHub repository Issues list](https://github.com/super-structure/com.bentley.dita.v1_1/issues).
